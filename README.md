# Middleplate 

> The ULTIMATE template for Middleman! -- *you in 5 minutes*

Ok, close all the other windows you have open in your search for a great Middleman boilerplate project. You've found it.

Middleplate gives you all the sane defaults you need for Middleman:

- Support for webpack (so you can `require('bootstrap')` to your ❤'s content)
- Support for autoreload -- see your changes on save! ✨
- Support for `slim` (trust me, you'll thank me later) 
- Support for `.env` files

## Setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `bundle exec middleman serve` for preview / `bundle exec middleman build` for build
